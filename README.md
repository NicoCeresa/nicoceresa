# Welcome to my Github!

**My name is Domenico but you can call me Nico**

- I am currently working on my Masters in Computer Science at Georgia Tech with a specialization in machine learning
</br>
- I am building a computer vision app called Crux Cam. It is used to analyze a climber's body movements to model their climbing movement and provide insights.
</br>
- I recently built a Deep Learning model that uses Super Resolution to upscale images up to 4x! I implemented [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.00367.pdf) paper and achieved results within 2db of the paper's results! To see my work, [click here](https://github.com/NicoCeresa/FSRCNN-2016)
