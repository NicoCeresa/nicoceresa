# Welcome to my Github!

**My name is Domenico but you can call me Nico**

- I am pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at Georgia Tech with a specialization in machine learning.

- I am building a computer vision app that impliments a pose estimation model. The model analyzes a climber's movement and gives the user feedback based on their body positioning throughout the climb.

- I recently built a deep learning model that uses Super Resolution to upscale images up to 4x! I implemented [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.00367.pdf) paper and achieved results within 2db/1% of the paper's results! To see my work, [click here](https://github.com/NicoCeresa/FSRCNN-2016).
